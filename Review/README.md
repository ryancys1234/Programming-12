Notes on variables, functions, and mode frameworks:

    Global variables are variables at the top and accessible anywhere.

    Variable names / types: int (integer), float (number with decimals / rational number), color (integer which represents color), boolean (true or false), string (text), char (a single character)

    Declaring a variable involves giving it a name and specifying the type of value it stores.

    Rules for naming variables: Only use letters, numbers, and the dollar sign (but no other symbols, including spaces). If there is more than one word, the first word is lowercase, but every subsequent word is capitalized. This is known as lowerCamelCase.

    The variable names int, float, boolean, and so on need only appear once at the beginning.

    '=' is used to assign values, while '==' is used to compare values.
