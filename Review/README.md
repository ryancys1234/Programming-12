# Review
This repository contains files and projects made in the review unit at the start of the Programming 12 course. A summary of notes on variables, functions, and mode frameworks is shown below.

Global variables are variables at the top and accessible anywhere.

Variable names / types:
    int (integer)
    float (number with decimal / rational)
    color (store integer that represent color)
    boolean (stores true or false)
    string (stores text)
    char (a single character)

Declaring a variable involves giving it a name and specifying the type of value it stores.

Rules for naming variables:
    Only use letters, numbers, and the dollar sign (but no other symbols, including spaces).
    If there is more than one word, the first word is lowercase, but every subsequent word is capitalized. This is known as lowerCamelCase.

The variable names int, float, boolean, and so on need only appear once at the beginning.

'=' is used to assign values, while '==' is used to compare values.
